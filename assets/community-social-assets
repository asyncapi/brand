# AsyncAPI Social Media Assets

Hi there!
Welcome to the central file for creating AsyncAPI social media visuals.
This space is designed to keep our branding consistent and make it easier for contributors to work with ready-made templates.

## Purpose
The purpose of these assets is to:
- Provide ready-to-use templates for social media posts.
- Maintain a unified branding for the AsyncAPI Initiative.
- Save time for designers and contributors by reusing approved layouts, typography, and colors.

## How to Contribute - Step by Step
1. Download the AsyncAPI Design System 
- Make sure you have the [AsyncAPI Design System](https://www.figma.com/design/cFsY4LCfKmDqdlaTIJPpA1/AsyncAPI-Design-System?node-id=0-1&t=3tA1jqC9CLz2kfPp-1) duplicated to your Figma workspace. This ensures you have access to all required components.

2. Copy the Template
- Open the [Community Social Assets-Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/LgSxCOVi0iE2I7gijl5rf0/Community-Social-Assets?node-id=0-1&t=4GTYhSy2Sv1eqqsL-1)and duplicate the relevant template (both the example and the template) to your Figma file.

3. Edit Text & Images Only
- Do not change brand colors, fonts, or layout elements.
- Only replace the placeholder text and images

4. Prepare Your Images
- All images used in templates must have a transparent background.  
- Use [remove.bg](https://remove.bg). It’s free and quick.

5. Submit Your Work
- Post your design in the #design_12 Slack channel, *or*
- Open a new issue in the [Brand Repo](https://github.com/asyncapi/brand) and tag the *Design Lead* @mayaleeee.
- Wait for a few days to get a review of your work.

## Requesting a New Social Media Design
- Make sure to double-check if the issue has not been created before to avoid duplicate issues.
- Open an issue in the [Brand Repo](https://github.com/asyncapi/brand).
- Tag the design lead so it can be assigned to anyone interested on time.

## Feedback or Suggestions?
- Use the #design_12 channel on Slack or open an issue in the [Brand Repo](https://github.com/asyncapi/brand).
