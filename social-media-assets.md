Hi there!

Welcome to the central file for creating AsyncAPI social media visuals.
This space is designed to keep our branding consistent and make it easier for contributors to work with ready-made templates.


## Purpose
The purpose of these assets is to:
- Provide ready-to-use templates for social media posts.
- Maintain a unified branding for the AsyncAPI Initiative.
- Save time for designers and contributors by reusing approved layouts, typography, and colors.

## How to Contribute - Step by Step
**1. Download the AsyncAPI Design System** 
- Make sure you have the [AsyncAPI Design System](https://www.figma.com/design/cFsY4LCfKmDqdlaTIJPpA1/AsyncAPI-Design-System?node-id=0-1&t=3tA1jqC9CLz2kfPp-1) duplicated to your Figma workspace. This ensures you have access to all required components.

2. Copy the Template
- Open the [Community Social Assets-Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/LgSxCOVi0iE2I7gijl5rf0/Community-Social-Assets?node-id=0-1&t=4GTYhSy2Sv1eqqsL-1) and copy the relevant template (both the example and the template) to your Figma file.

- The example is provided to help you ensure that every change made to the template looks the same as the example when completed.

3. Edit Text & Images Only

4. Prepare Your Images
- All images used in templates must have a transparent background.  
- Use [remove.bg](https://remove.bg). It’s free and quick.
